Instead, they were building with simple, composable patterns.\n\nIn this post, we share what we\u2019ve learned from working with our customers and building agents ourselves, and give practical advice for developers on building effective agents.\n\n## What are agents?\n\n\"Agent\" can be defined in several ways. Some customers define agents as fully autonomous systems that operate independently over extended periods, using various tools to accomplish complex tasks. Others use the term to describe more prescriptive implementations that follow predefined workflows. At Anthropic, we categorize all these variations as **agentic systems**, but draw an important architectural distinction between **workflows** and **agents**:\n\n* **Workflows** are systems where LLMs and tools are orchestrated through predefined code paths.\n* **Agents**, on the other hand, are systems where LLMs dynamically direct their own processes and tool usage, maintaining control over how they accomplish tasks.\n\nBelow, we will explore both types of agentic systems in detail. In Appendix 1 (\u201cAgents in Practice\u201d), we describe two domains where customers have found particular value in using these kinds of systems.\n\n## When (and when not) to use agents\n\nWhen building applications with LLMs, we recommend finding the simplest solution possible, and only increasing complexity when needed. This might mean not building agentic systems at all. Agentic systems often trade latency and cost for better task performance, and you should consider when this tradeoff makes sense.\n\nWhen more complexity is warranted, workflows offer predictability and consistency for well-defined tasks, whereas agents are the better option when flexibility and model-driven decision-making are needed at scale.
